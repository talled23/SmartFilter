#Technologies:
The project contains Front End and Back End Sections. The following technologies were used:

Front End:
  - WordPress for Site Development, we needed to develop a PHP plugin so that WordPress would not override our code
  - PHP, HTML, JavaScript all used to create the page contents and connect with the Back End

Back End:
  - GoDaddy, the site used for all Web Hosting, also hosts the database online
  - phpMyAdmin, a MySQL database
  - SQL query language, used to read and write in the database
